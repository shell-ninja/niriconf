### I will prepare the READMD after I complete developing the scripts. 😁

### For now, just follow these steps to install and setup.

> [!NOTE]
> This dotfiles are now under development. It might contain bugs and running the scripts might create issues. Be careful before you run the installation script. Also it's only for Arch Linux till now. Soon I'll prepare it for Fedora too.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/shell-ninja/niriconf
cd niriconf
chmod +x niri.sh
./niri.sh
```
